<b>Question</b>

A sheet of BCC iron 2 mm thick was exposed to a carburizing gas atmosphere on one side and a decarburizing atmosphere on the other side at 675Â°C. After reaching steady state, the iron was quickly cooled to room temperature. The carbon concentrations at the two surfaces of the sheet were determined to be 0.015 and 0.0068 wt%, respectively. Compute the diffusion coefficient if the diffusion flux is 7.36 x 10-9 kg/m2-s. 

<b>Hint<b> 

Use conversion from weight percent to mass per unit volume) to convert the concentration from weight percent to kilograms of carbon per cubic meter of iron. Density of iron = 7.87 g/cm3. Density of carbon = 2.25 g/cm3.

<b>Answer</b>

<b>2.3*10<sup>-11</sup> m<sup>2</sup>/s</b>
